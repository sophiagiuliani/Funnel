# Funnel

A company that has an online platform can make smart decisions if it know which part of the purchasing process the customers leave the website. Having this data could improve the process of purchasing, bringing more revenue to the company and a better experiene to the customer. To make this analysis I used a funnel chart where it is possible to compare the percentages of customers in each step of the purchasing process. In this analysis, two paths were chosen, one to analyse especifically the efficiency of promotions, and the other the perception of the products and purchase process. Only data from the three top countries was used.

In addition, I made an analysis of the customers grouped by their mobile brand, to check if there is a especific profile that behaves differently in the platform. The visualization was made using google sheets. Suggestions for each step of the process are included.
